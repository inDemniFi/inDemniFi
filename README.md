## Bitcoin Olympics Hackathon

This is the repository for inDemniFi, which is a risk intelligence platform for the distributed world. Right now our focus is on Bitcoin and creating a security focused wallet and risk dashboard for wallet holders, while eventually offering insurance for those wallet holders. That is where Uberrimae Fidei comes into play.
