This is the repository for inDemniFi, which is a risk intelligence platform for the distributed world. Right now our focus is on Bitcoin and creating a security focused wallet and risk dashboard for wallet holders, while eventually offering insurance for those wallet holders. 

Currently, we are focused on the Bitcoin Olympics hackathon which can be seen in the four pinned repositories below.
